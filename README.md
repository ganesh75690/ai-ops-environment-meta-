# 🧠 Overview

AI Ops Intelligence System is a simulation-driven environment designed to train and evaluate AI agents for real-world operational decision-making.

It replicates a dynamic business workflow where agents must:

- Analyze incoming operational tasks
- Prioritize based on urgency and system context
- Select optimal actions
- Learn through reward-based feedback loops

«🚀 This system is not just an API — it is a foundation for training autonomous operational intelligence.»

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern organizations struggle with:

- High volumes of operational tasks
- Delayed incident response
- Inefficient prioritization
- Manual decision bottlenecks

These challenges lead to:

- Reduced system reliability
- Increased operational cost
- Slower response times

---

# 💡 Solution

This project introduces a structured AI training environment where agents learn intelligent decision-making.

Core Capabilities:

- 📌 Task prioritization (low → critical)
- ⚙️ Action selection (assign, escalate, resolve, ignore)
- 📊 Reward-based optimization
- 🔁 Continuous learning loop

# ⚙️ API Endpoints

These endpoints allow interaction with the AI Ops environment:

| Endpoint   | Description              |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `/reset`   | Reset environment        |
| `/step`    | Execute agent action     |
| `/state`   | Get current system state |
| `/tasks`   | List all tasks           |
| `/grader`  | Evaluate decisions       |
| `/baseline`| Run baseline agent       |

---

# 🤖 Baseline Agent

A rule-based agent is included to:

- Demonstrate environment interaction
- Provide reproducible results
