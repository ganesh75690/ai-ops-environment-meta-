🧠 Overview

AI Ops Intelligence is a simulation environment designed to train and evaluate AI agents for real-world operational decision-making.
It mimics a business operations workflow where agents must:

- Analyze incoming tasks
- Prioritize them based on urgency
- Choose appropriate actions
- Optimize outcomes using reward-based feedback
This environment follows the OpenEnv standard for building agent training systems.

---
🎯 Problem Statement

Modern organizations face challenges in:
- Managing high volumes of tasks
- Prioritizing critical incidents
- Efficient resource allocation

Manual handling leads to inefficiencies and delays.
---

💡 Solution
This project provides a structured AI training environment where agents learn to:

- 📌 Classify task priorities
- ⚙️ Decide correct actions (assign, escalate, ignore)
- 📊 Optimize decisions using reward-based evaluation

⚙️ API Endpoints

Endpoint| Description
"/reset"| Reset environment
"/step"| Execute agent action
"/state"| View current state
"/tasks"| List all tasks
"/grader"| Evaluate actions
"/baseline"| Run baseline agent

---

🤖 Baseline Agent

A simple rule-based agent is included to:

- Interact with the environment
- Generate reproducible results
- Provide evaluation benchmarks


## 🧠 Learning Mechanism

The agent improves through:

1. Observing system state  
2. Taking actions  
3. Receiving reward signals  
4. Adjusting strategy  

This loop enables optimization over time.

---

📈 Reward System

The environment uses reward shaping:

- ✔ Correct decisions → Positive reward
- ⚠ Partial correctness → Partial reward
- ❌ Incorrect decisions → Penalty

This enables realistic AI training scenarios.
